/** TimeZone - A structure representing a time zone.
 * TimeZone is a structure that represents a time zone, at no particular point
 * in time. It is refcounted and immutable.
 *
 * A time zone contains a number of intervals. Each interval has an
 * abbreviation to describe it, an offet to UTC and a flag indicating if the
 * daylight savings time is in effect during that interval. A time zone always
 * has at least one interval -- interval 0.
 *
 * Every UTC time is contained within exactly one interval, but a given local
 * time may be contained within zero, one or two intervals (due to
 * incontinuities associated with daylight savings time).
 *
 * An interval may refer to a specific period of time (eg: the duration of
 * daylight savings time during 2010) or it may refer to many periods of time
 * that share the same properties (eg: all periods of daylight savings time).
 * It is also possible (usually for political reasons) that some properties
 * (like the abbreviation) change between intervals without other properties
 * changing.

   * is <tt>0</tt> then <filename>/etc/localtime</filename> will be consulted
   * to discover the correct timezone.

   * (the <varname>time-offset</varname> expansion) and ISO 8601 for the
   * full list of valid time offsets.  See The
   * GNU C Library manual for an explanation of the possible
